### Hi ðŸ‘‹


YOU are the âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository 

I liked all of the 'ideas to get me started', so:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a java name collection project (to benefit the transgender community and/or new parents), developing my coding skills, and a wellness podcast
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js, REACT, Javascript, CSS, HTML
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun innovative ideas to help others 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with convincing my cat to stop attacking my feet at night (fr)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the time I directed a film! OR....about the time I got stuck in Russia 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/devonmercadante
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: sono anche un artista
